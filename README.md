# Time-calculator-
The main function is called add_time(x,y)
it takes two string arguments, (x) in the format of a 12 hours time cycle, and (y) the number of hours you'd like to increase it by.
The first string argument (x) takes a string format for time like this ("7:04 AM", "11:55AM", or "7:09 PM").

Argument (y) is entered as a string in the same way you would enter (x), instead, (y) takes the amount of time you are going to adding to (x)
for example: add_time ("11:50AM", "2:10") Returns 2:00PM, add_time ("11:43 AM", "00:20") Returns: 12:03 PM
